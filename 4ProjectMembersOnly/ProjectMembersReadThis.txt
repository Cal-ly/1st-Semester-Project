If you are new to Git and GitHub, please read:

The easiest way to integrate with GitHub is downloading GitHub Desktop. 
Then you clone this repository so you have a local copy, from where you can work on the project. Just choose <show in explorer> and open solution with /VisualStudio 2022/.

When working on the project (or derived files) you need to first <COMMIT> (this will add the changes to your LOCAL repository - the clone) and then <PUSH> those changes to the remote repository (Placed on GitHub servers).
I order to deconflict preemptively, use <SYNC> instead. This will first <PULL> all changes and then <PUSH> your changes to the remote repository.

There are no stupid questions - just ask :)
